# Dimensionality-Reduction-Methods

## Method 1 - Principal Component Analysis
This method can find a projection axis to maximize the distance between each point in data.\
There is an example as follows, red points are the original dataset, bule line is the projection by PCA.\

Moreover, we choose the swiss roll dataset to apply by PCA.\

# Dimensionality-Reduction-Methods

## Method 1 - Principal Component Analysis
PCA is a linear unsupervised learning tool for dimensional reduction, since high-dimensional data cannot be observed or analyzed intuitively, PCA gives a method that preserves the characteristics of each dimension as much as possible in a lower dimensional space.\
Here is an example, which is 2-dimensional reduct to one line. Red points are the original dataset, bule line is the projection by PCA.\

From this, it can be observed that the points after the projection are separated as much as possible.
Moreover, we choose the swiss roll dataset to apply by PCA.\

## Method 2 - MultiDimensional Scaling

## Method 3 - Linear Discriminant Analysis
